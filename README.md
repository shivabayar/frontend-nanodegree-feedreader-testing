# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## How to run this project?
1. Clone this project
2. Make sure that `node` and `npm` are installed in the development machine
3. Run npm install inside the project root folder
4. In command line run `gulp`, this runs the application as well as the Jasmine tests
